Project kick off session, where you should get clear of for what and why this project and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with dashboard

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be time dead-line of the project?
- do the stakeholders expecting pre-view before the actual release?

After the project kick off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of data analytics team, letâ€™s explore them.

### Dataset **Understanding.**

Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table : It will have the static data like details of customer and products

Fact table : It will have the data about the transactions  

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed Snowflake data modeling method.
